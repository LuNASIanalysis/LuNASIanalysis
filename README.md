ðŸ‘‹ This is @LuNASIanalysis, the repositiry of the software for data analysis and modelling of the physical phenomena developed by the LuNASI research group

Luminescent nanoparticle Assisted Sensing and Imaging Group (LuNASI) is research group from the Institute of Low Temperatures and Structure Research, Polish Academy of Sciences in WrocÅ‚aw, Poland.
We are focused on the material science, spectroscopy, luminescence thermometry and imaging. Please, follow our webpage (https://lunasi.intibs.pl/) to learn more about the members of our group, our current research projects and the new results!

This is a special repository of the software codes developed in our group for automatized analysis and presentation of the experimental data ðŸ“° , as well as for numerical modelling of the physical phenomena ðŸ“ˆ. 

Enjoy! ðŸ˜„
